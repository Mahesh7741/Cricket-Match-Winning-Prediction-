# Cricket Match Winning Prediction

This project aims to predict the outcome of cricket matches using deep learning models. By leveraging historical match data, player statistics, and various match-related features, the model predicts whether a given team will win or lose a cricket match.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares historical cricket data for model training, handling missing values and feature engineering.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trains a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras for predicting match outcomes based on multiple input features.
- **Prediction**: Predicts match outcomes (win/loss) for upcoming cricket matches using the trained model.
- **Visualization**: Displays visualizations such as accuracy and loss curves, as well as predictions for upcoming matches.

## Dataset
The model utilizes publicly available datasets containing cricket match details, player statistics, and other relevant features. You can source the dataset from platforms like Kaggle or use custom CSV files.
